The Kiwijam18 theme was 'single use', in our game the matches and keys are single use items.

**v0.4.2** was the version submitted for the gamejam. Check out the [releases](https://github.com/South-Paw/kiwijam18/releases) tab for other versions.

If you want to run it locally, you'll need an http server running on localhost as loading the assets without one will create cross origin request issues.
